Self-hosted AI agent orchestration dashboard. Manage multiple AI providers, orchestrate agent swarms, schedule tasks, and bridge agents to chat platforms — all from a single mobile-friendly interface.

Inspired by [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw).

![Task Board](public/screenshots/tasks.png)

- Always use the access key authentication (generated on first run)
- Never expose port 3456 without a reverse proxy + TLS
- Review agent system prompts before giving them shell or browser tools
- Repeated failed access key attempts are rate-limited to slow brute-force attacks

## Features

- **15 Built-in Providers** — Claude Code CLI, OpenAI Codex CLI, OpenCode CLI, Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, Groq, Together AI, Mistral AI, xAI (Grok), Fireworks AI, Ollama, plus custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- **OpenClaw Gateway** — Per-agent toggle to connect any agent to a local or remote OpenClaw gateway. Each agent gets its own gateway URL and token — run a swarm of OpenClaws from one dashboard. The `openclaw` CLI ships as a bundled dependency (no separate install needed)
- **OpenClaw Control Plane** — Built-in gateway connection controls, reload mode switching (hot/hybrid/full), config issue detection/repair, remote history sync, and live execution approval handling
- **Agent Builder** — Create agents with custom personalities (soul), system prompts, tools, and skills. AI-powered generation from a description
- **Agent Inspector Panel** — Per-agent side panel for OpenClaw file editing (`SOUL.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `USER.md`, etc.), guided personality editing, skill install/enable/remove, permission presets, sandbox env allowlist, and cron automations
- **Agent Fleet Management** — Avatar seeds with generated avatars, running/approval fleet filters, soft-delete agent trash with restore/permanent delete, and approval counters in agent cards
- **Agent Tools** — Shell, process control for long-running commands, files, edit file, send file, web search, web fetch, CLI delegation (Claude/Codex/OpenCode), Playwright browser automation, persistent memory, and sandboxed code execution (JS/TS via Deno, Python)
- **Platform Tools** — Agents can manage other agents, tasks, schedules, skills, connectors, sessions, and encrypted secrets via built-in platform tools
- **Orchestration** — Multi-agent workflows powered by LangGraph with automatic sub-agent routing, checkpointed execution, and rich delegation cards that link to sub-agent chat threads
- **Agentic Execution Policy** — Tool-first autonomous action loop with progress updates, evidence-driven answers, and better use of platform tools for long-lived work
- **Task Board** — Queue and track agent tasks with status, comments, results, and archiving. Strict capability policy pauses tasks for human approval before tool execution
- **Background Daemon** — Auto-processes queued tasks and scheduled jobs with a 30s heartbeat plus recurring health monitoring
- **Scheduling** — Cron-based agent scheduling with human-friendly presets
- **Loop Runtime Controls** — Switch between bounded and ongoing loops with configurable step caps, runtime guards, heartbeat cadence, and timeout budgets
- **Session Run Queue** — Per-session queued runs with followup/steer/collect modes, collect coalescing for bursty inputs, and run-state APIs
- **Chat Iteration Workflow** — Edit-and-resend user turns, fork a new session from any message, bookmark key messages, use contextual follow-up suggestion chips, and auto-continue after tool access grants
- **Agent Chatrooms** — Multi-agent room conversations with `@mention` routing, chained agent replies, reactions, and file/image-aware chat context
- **Live Chat Telemetry** — Thinking/tool/responding stream phases, live main-loop status badges, connector activity presence, tone indicator, and optional sound notifications
- **Global Search Palette** — `Cmd/Ctrl+K` search across agents, tasks, sessions, schedules, webhooks, and skills from anywhere in the app
- **Notification Center** — Real-time in-app notifications for task/schedule/daemon events with unread tracking, mark-all/clear-read controls, and optional action links
- **Preview-Rich Chat UI** — Side preview panel for tool outputs (image/browser/html/code), inline code/PDF previews for attachments, and image lightbox support
- **Voice Settings** — Per-instance ElevenLabs API key + voice ID for TTS replies, plus configurable speech recognition language for chat input
- **Chat Connectors** — Bridge agents to Discord, Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp, BlueBubbles (iMessage), Signal, Microsoft Teams, Google Chat, Matrix, and OpenClaw with media-aware inbound handling
- **Skills System** — Discover local skills, import skills from URL, and load OpenClaw `SKILL.md` files (frontmatter-compatible)
- **Execution Logging** — Structured audit trail for triggers, tool calls, file ops, commits, and errors in a dedicated `logs.db`
- **Context Management** — Auto-compaction of conversation history when approaching context limits, with manual `context_status` and `context_summarize` tools for agents
- **Memory** — Per-agent and per-session memory with hybrid FTS5 + vector embeddings search, relevance-based memory recall injected into runs, and periodic auto-journaling for durable execution context
- **Cost Tracking** — Per-message token counting and cost estimation displayed in the chat header
- **Provider Health Metrics** — Usage dashboard surfaces provider request volume, success rates, models used, and last-used timestamps
- **Model Failover** — Automatic key rotation on rate limits and auth errors with configurable fallback credentials
- **Plugin System** — Extend agent behavior with JS plugins (hooks: beforeAgentStart, afterAgentComplete, beforeToolExec, afterToolExec, onMessage)
- **Secrets Vault** — Encrypted storage for API keys and service tokens
- **Custom Providers** — Add any OpenAI-compatible API as a provider
- **MCP Servers** — Connect agents to any Model Context Protocol server. Per-agent server selection with tool discovery and per-tool disable toggles
- **Sandboxed Code Execution** — Agents can write and run JS/TS (Deno) or Python scripts in an isolated sandbox with network access, scoped filesystem, and artifact output
- **Real-Time Sync** — WebSocket push notifications for instant UI updates across tabs and devices (fallback to polling when WS is unavailable)
- **Mobile-First UI** — Responsive glass-themed dark interface, works on phone and desktop

## Requirements

- **Node.js** 22.6+
- **npm** 10+
- **Claude Code CLI** (optional, for `claude-cli` provider) — [Install](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/overview)
- **OpenAI Codex CLI** (optional, for `codex-cli` provider) — [Install](https://github.com/openai/codex)
- **OpenCode CLI** (optional, for `opencode-cli` provider) — [Install](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode)

## Quick Start

### npm (recommended)

```bash
npm i -g @swarmclawai/swarmclaw
swarmclaw
```

### Install script

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw/main/install.sh | bash
```

The installer resolves the latest stable release tag and installs that version by default.
To pin a version: `SWARMCLAW_VERSION=v0.6.0 curl ... | bash`

Or run locally from the repo (friendly for non-technical users):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
npm run quickstart
```

`npm run quickstart` will:
- Check Node/npm versions
- Install dependencies
- Prepare `.env.local` and `data/`
- Start the app at `http://localhost:3456`

`postinstall` rebuilds `better-sqlite3` natively. If you install with `--ignore-scripts`, run `npm rebuild better-sqlite3` manually.

On first launch, SwarmClaw will:
1. Generate an **access key** and display it in the terminal
2. Save it to `.env.local`
3. Show a first-time setup screen in the browser with the key to copy

Open `http://localhost:3456` (or your machine's IP for mobile access). Enter the access key, set your name, and you're in.

### Command-Line Setup (No UI Required)

You can complete first-time setup from terminal:

```bash
# Start the app (if not already running)
npm run dev

# In another terminal, run setup with your provider
node ./bin/swarmclaw.js setup init --provider openai --api-key "$OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

Notes:
- On a fresh instance, `setup init` can auto-discover and claim the first-run access key from `/api/auth`.
- For existing installs, pass `--key <ACCESS_KEY>` (or set `SWARMCLAW_ACCESS_KEY`).
- `setup init` performs provider validation, stores credentials, creates a starter agent, and marks setup complete.
- Use `--skip-check` to bypass connection validation.

### 2-Minute Setup Wizard

After login, SwarmClaw opens a guided wizard designed for non-technical users:

1. Choose a provider: **OpenAI**, **Anthropic**, or **Ollama**
2. Add only required fields (API key and/or endpoint)
3. Click **Check Connection** for live validation before continuing
4. (Optional) click **Run System Check** for setup diagnostics
5. Create a starter assistant (advanced settings are optional)

Notes:
- Ollama checks can auto-suggest a model from the connected endpoint.
- OpenClaw is configured per-agent via the **OpenClaw Gateway** toggle (not in the setup wizard).
- You can skip setup and configure everything later in the sidebar.

## Configuration

All config lives in `.env.local` (auto-generated):

```
ACCESS_KEY=<your-access-key>       # Auth key for the dashboard
CREDENTIAL_SECRET=<auto-generated> # AES-256 encryption key for stored credentials
```

Data is stored in `data/swarmclaw.db` (SQLite with WAL mode), `data/memory.db` (agent memory with FTS5 + vector embeddings), `data/logs.db` (execution audit trail), and `data/langgraph-checkpoints.db` (orchestrator checkpoints). Back the `data/` directory up if you care about your sessions, agents, and credentials. Existing JSON file data is auto-migrated to SQLite on first run.

The app listens on two ports: `PORT` (default 3456) for the HTTP/SSE API, and `PORT + 1` (default 3457) for WebSocket push notifications. The WS port can be customized with `--ws-port`.

### OpenClaw

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) is an open-source autonomous AI agent that runs on your own devices. SwarmClaw includes the `openclaw` CLI as a bundled dependency — no separate install needed.

To connect an agent to an OpenClaw gateway:

1. Create or edit an agent
2. Toggle **OpenClaw Gateway** ON
3. Enter the gateway URL (e.g. `http://192.168.1.50:18789` or `https://my-vps:18789`)
4. Add a gateway token if authentication is enabled on the remote gateway
5. Click **Connect** — approve the device in your gateway's dashboard if prompted, then **Retry Connection**

Each agent can point to a **different** OpenClaw gateway — one local, several remote. This is how you manage a **swarm of OpenClaws** from a single dashboard.

URLs without a protocol are auto-prefixed with `http://`. For remote gateways with TLS, use `https://` explicitly.

## Chat Connectors

Bridge any agent to a chat platform:

| Platform | Library | Setup |
|-|-|-|
| Discord | discord.js | Bot token + channel IDs |
| Slack | @slack/bolt | Bot token + app token (Socket Mode) |
| Telegram | grammy | Bot token from @BotFather |
| WhatsApp | baileys | QR code pairing (shown in browser) |
| BlueBubbles | Custom webhook bridge | Server URL + password/webhook secret |
| Signal | signal-cli | `signal-cli` binary + linked phone |
| Microsoft Teams | botbuilder | Bot Framework credentials + webhook ingress |
| Google Chat | googleapis | Service account + webhook ingress |
| Matrix | matrix-bot-sdk | Homeserver URL + access token |
| OpenClaw | gateway protocol | OpenClaw connector credentials |

Connector sessions preserve attachment visibility in chat context:
- WhatsApp media is decoded and persisted to `/api/uploads/...` when possible
- Telegram and Slack attachments are downloaded to uploads when possible
- Discord attachments are captured as media metadata/URLs

Agents automatically suppress replies to simple acknowledgments ("ok", "thanks", thumbs-up, etc.) via a `NO_MESSAGE` response — conversations feel natural without a forced reply to every message. This is handled at the connector layer, so agents can return `NO_MESSAGE` as their response content and the platform won't deliver anything to the channel.

For proactive outreach, `connector_message_tool` supports text plus optional `imageUrl` / `fileUrl` / `mediaPath` (local file path) payloads. WhatsApp, Discord, Slack, and Telegram support local file sending via `mediaPath` with auto-detected MIME types.

Connector ingress now also supports optional pairing/allowlist policy:
- `dmPolicy: allowlist` blocks unknown senders until approved
- `/pair` flow lets approved admins generate and approve pairing codes
- `/think` command can set connector thread thinking level (`low`, `medium`, `high`)

## Agent Tools

Agents can use the following tools when enabled:

| Tool | Description |
|-|-|
| Shell | Execute commands in the session working directory |
| Process | Control long-running shell commands (`process_tool`) |
| Files | Read, write, list, and send files |
| Copy/Move/Delete File | Optional file ops (`copy_file`, `move_file`, `delete_file`) configurable per agent/session (`delete_file` is off by default) |
| Edit File | Search-and-replace editing (exact match required) |
| Web Search | Search the web via DuckDuckGo HTML scraping |
| Web Fetch | Fetch and extract text content from URLs (uses cheerio) |
| CLI Delegation | Delegate complex tasks to Claude Code, Codex CLI, or OpenCode CLI |
| Browser | Playwright-powered web browsing via MCP (navigate, click, type, screenshot, PDF) |
| Memory | Store and retrieve long-term memories with FTS5 + vector search, file references, image attachments, and linked memory graph traversal |
| Sandbox | Run JS/TS (Deno) or Python code in an isolated sandbox. Created files are returned as downloadable artifacts |
| MCP Servers | Connect to external Model Context Protocol servers. Tools from MCP servers are injected as first-class agent tools |

### Platform Tools

Agents with platform tools enabled can manage the SwarmClaw instance:

| Tool | Description |
|-|-|
| Manage Agents | List, create, update, delete agents |
| Manage Tasks | Create and manage task board items with agent assignment |
| Manage Schedules | Create cron, interval, or one-time scheduled jobs |
| Manage Skills | List, create, update reusable skill definitions |
| Manage Documents | Upload/search/get/delete indexed docs for lightweight RAG workflows |
| Manage Webhooks | Register external webhook endpoints that trigger agent sessions |
| Manage Connectors | Manage chat platform bridges |
| Manage Chatrooms | Create/list/update chatrooms, manage members, and post room messages for multi-agent collaboration |
| Manage Sessions | Enable `sessions_tool` for list/history/status/send/spawn/stop, plus `context_status` and `context_summarize` for context window management |
| Manage Secrets | Store and retrieve encrypted reusable secrets |

Enable tools per-session or per-agent in the UI. CLI providers (Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode) handle tools natively through their own CLI.
OpenClaw provider capabilities are also managed remotely in OpenClaw itself, so local Tools/Platform toggles are hidden for OpenClaw agents.

## Starter Skills (URL Import)

Import these directly in **Skills → Import via URL**:

- `https://swarmclaw.ai/skills/openclaw-swarmclaw-bridge/SKILL.md`
- `https://swarmclaw.ai/skills/swarmclaw-bootstrap/SKILL.md`

## Cost Tracking

Token usage and estimated costs are tracked per message for API-based providers (Anthropic, OpenAI). After each response, a badge in the chat header shows token count and estimated cost.

- **API endpoint:** `GET /api/usage` — returns usage summary by session and provider
- **Data:** Stored in `data/swarmclaw.db` (usage table)
- Cost estimates use published model pricing (updated manually in `src/lib/server/cost.ts`)

## Background Daemon

The daemon auto-processes queued tasks from the scheduler on a 30-second interval. It also runs recurring health checks that detect stale heartbeat sessions and can send proactive WhatsApp alerts when issues are detected. Toggle the daemon from the sidebar indicator or via API.

Daemon runtime also triggers memory consolidation (daily summary generation plus recurring dedupe/prune maintenance).

- **API:** `GET /api/daemon` (status), `POST /api/daemon` with `{"action": "start"}` or `{"action": "stop"}`
- Auto-starts on first authenticated runtime traffic (`/api/auth` or `/api/daemon`) unless `SWARMCLAW_DAEMON_AUTOSTART=0`

## Main Agent Loop

For autonomous long-running missions, enable the **Main Loop** on a session. This lets an agent pursue a goal continuously with heartbeat-driven progress checks and automatic followups.

- **Heartbeat prompts:** `SWARM_MAIN_MISSION_TICK` triggers on each heartbeat, giving the agent its goal, status, and pending events
- **Auto-followup:** When an agent returns `[MAIN_LOOP_META] {"follow_up":true}`, the loop schedules another tick after `delay_sec`
- **Mission state:** Tracks `goal`, `status` (idle/progress/blocked/ok), `summary`, `nextAction`, `autonomyMode` (assist/autonomous), and pending events
- **Autonomy modes:**
  - `autonomous`: Agent executes safe actions without confirmation, only asks when blocked by permissions/credentials
  - `assist`: Agent asks before irreversible external actions (sending messages, purchases, account mutations)
- **API:** `POST /api/sessions/[id]/main-loop` with `{"tick":true}` to trigger a mission tick
- **CLI:** `swarmclaw sessions main-loop <id>` to inspect loop state, or `swarmclaw sessions main-loop-action <id> --data '{"action":"nudge"}'` to control it

Use this for background agents that should "keep working" on a goal until blocked or complete.

## Loop Modes

Configure loop behavior in **Settings → Runtime & Loop Controls**:

- **Bounded**: fixed max steps for agent and orchestrator loops (default behavior)
- **Ongoing**: loops keep iterating until they hit your safety cap and optional runtime limit

You can also tune shell timeout, Claude Code delegation timeout, and CLI provider process timeout from the same settings panel.

## Capability Policy

Configure this in **Settings → Capability Policy** to centrally govern tool access:

- **Mode:** `permissive`, `balanced`, or `strict`
- **Blocked categories:** e.g. `execution`, `filesystem`, `platform`, `outbound`
- **Blocked tools:** specific tool families or concrete tool names
- **Allowed tools:** explicit overrides when running stricter modes

Policy is enforced in both session tool construction and direct forced tool invocations, so auto-routing and explicit tool requests use the same guardrails.

## CLI Troubleshooting

- **Claude delegate returns no output or fails quickly:** verify Claude auth on the host with:
  - `claude auth status`
  - If not logged in: `claude auth login` (or `claude setup-token`)
- **Claude delegate times out:** increase **Claude Code Timeout (sec)** in Settings.
- **Codex fails outside a git repo:** SwarmClaw now uses `--skip-git-repo-check`, but if login is missing run:
  - `codex login`
  - `codex login status`
- **CLI provider errors are now surfaced in chat:** non-zero exits and streamed error events are emitted as chat errors instead of failing silently.

## Voice & Heartbeat

Configure these in **Settings**:

- **Voice** — set `ElevenLabs API Key`, `ElevenLabs Voice ID`, and `Speech Recognition Language`
- **Heartbeat** — set `Heartbeat Interval (Seconds)` and `Heartbeat Prompt` for ongoing session pings
- **Global heartbeat safety** — use `Stop All Session Heartbeats` to disable heartbeat across all sessions and cancel in-flight heartbeat runs.

Heartbeat pings are internal checks for ongoing sessions. If there's no new status, the assistant returns `HEARTBEAT_OK`; otherwise it returns a concise progress update and next step. In chat UI, heartbeat entries render as compact expandable cards and consecutive heartbeat streaks are collapsed to the latest item.
The daemon health monitor also auto-disables heartbeat on sessions that remain stale for an extended period.

## Embeddings & Hybrid Memory Search

Enable semantic search for agent memory by configuring an embedding provider in Settings:

- **Local (Free)** — runs `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` directly in Node.js via HuggingFace Transformers. No API key, no cost, works offline. Model downloads once (~23MB).
- **OpenAI** — uses `text-embedding-3-small` (requires API key)
- **Ollama** — uses local models like `nomic-embed-text`

When enabled, new memories get vector embeddings. Search uses both FTS5 keyword matching and cosine similarity, merging results for better recall.

## Model Failover

Agents and sessions can have **fallback credentials**. If the primary API key gets a 401, 429, or 500 error, SwarmClaw automatically retries with the next credential. Configure fallback keys in the agent builder UI.

## Plugins

Extend agent behavior with JS plugins. Three ways to install:

1. **Marketplace** — Browse and install approved plugins from Settings → Plugins → Marketplace
2. **URL** — Install from any HTTPS URL via Settings → Plugins → Install from URL
3. **Manual** — Drop `.js` files into `data/plugins/`

### Plugin Format (SwarmClaw)

```js
module.exports = {
  name: 'my-plugin',
  description: 'What it does',
  hooks: {
    beforeAgentStart: async ({ session, message }) => { /* ... */ },
    afterAgentComplete: async ({ session, response }) => { /* ... */ },
    beforeToolExec: async ({ toolName, input }) => { /* ... */ },
    afterToolExec: async ({ toolName, input, output }) => { /* ... */ },
    onMessage: async ({ session, message }) => { /* ... */ },
  },
}
```

### OpenClaw Plugin Compatibility

SwarmClaw natively supports the OpenClaw plugin format. Drop an OpenClaw plugin into `data/plugins/` and it works automatically — lifecycle hooks are mapped:

| OpenClaw Hook | SwarmClaw Hook |
|-|-|
| `onAgentStart` | `beforeAgentStart` |
| `onAgentComplete` | `afterAgentComplete` |
| `onToolCall` | `beforeToolExec` |
| `onToolResult` | `afterToolExec` |
| `onMessage` | `onMessage` |

Plugin API: `GET /api/plugins`, `POST /api/plugins`, `GET /api/plugins/marketplace`, `POST /api/plugins/install`.

## Deploy to a VPS

### Direct (pm2 + Caddy)

```bash
# On your VPS
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
npm install
npm run build

# Run with pm2
sudo npm install -g pm2
pm2 start npm --name swarmclaw -- start
pm2 save && pm2 startup
```

Point a reverse proxy (Caddy or nginx) at `localhost:3456` for TLS. See the [full deployment guide](https://swarmclaw.ai/docs/deployment).

### Docker

```bash
git clone https://github.com/swarmclawai/swarmclaw.git
cd swarmclaw
docker compose up -d
```

Data is persisted in `data/` and `.env.local` via volume mounts. Updates: `git pull && docker compose up -d --build`.

For prebuilt images (recommended for non-technical users after releases):

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/swarmclawai/swarmclaw:latest
docker run -d \
  --name swarmclaw \
  -p 3456:3456 \
  -v "$(pwd)/data:/app/data" \
  -v "$(pwd)/.env.local:/app/.env.local" \
  ghcr.io/swarmclawai/swarmclaw:latest
```

### Updating

SwarmClaw has a built-in update checker — a banner appears in the sidebar when new commits are available, with a one-click update button. Your data in `data/` and `.env.local` is never touched by updates.

For terminal users, run:

```bash
npm run update:easy
```

This command updates to the latest stable release tag when available (fallback: `origin/main`), installs dependencies when needed, and runs a production build check before restart.

## Development

```bash
npm run dev          # Dev server on 0.0.0.0:3456
npm run dev:webpack  # Fallback to webpack dev server (if Turbopack crashes)
npm run dev:clean    # Clear .next cache then restart dev server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run build:ci     # CI build (skips ESLint; lint baseline runs separately)
npm run start        # Start production server
npm run start:standalone # Start standalone server after build
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run lint:baseline # Fail only on net-new lint issues vs .eslint-baseline.json
npm run lint:baseline:update # Refresh lint baseline intentionally
```

The dev server binds to `0.0.0.0` so you can access it from your phone on the same network.

### Turbopack Panic Recovery

If you see a Turbopack panic like `Failed to lookup task type` or missing `.sst/.meta` files:

```bash
rm -rf .next
npm run dev:clean
```

If it still reproduces, use webpack mode:

```bash
npm run dev:webpack
```

### First-Run Helpers

```bash
npm run setup:easy      # setup only (does not start server)
npm run quickstart      # setup + start dev server
npm run quickstart:prod # setup + build + start production server
npm run update:easy     # safe update helper for local installs
```

### Release Process (Maintainers)

SwarmClaw uses tag-based releases (`vX.Y.Z`) as the stable channel.

```bash
# example patch release
npm version patch
git push origin main --follow-tags
```

On `v*` tags, GitHub Actions will:
1. Run release gates (`npm run test:cli`, `npm run test:openclaw`, `npm run build:ci`)
2. Create a GitHub Release
3. Build and publish Docker images to `ghcr.io/swarmclawai/swarmclaw` (`:vX.Y.Z`, `:latest`, `:sha-*`)

## CLI

SwarmClaw ships a built-in CLI for core operational workflows:

```bash
# show command help
npm run cli -- --help

# or run the executable directly
node ./bin/swarmclaw.js --help
```

### Usage

```bash
swarmclaw [global-options] <group> <command> [command-options]

| `--json` | Compact JSON output |
| `--wait` | Wait for run/task completion when IDs are returned |
| `--timeout-ms <ms>` | Request/wait timeout (default `300000`) |
| `--interval-ms <ms>` | Poll interval for `--wait` (default `2000`) |
| `--out <file>` | Write binary response to file |

Routing note: `swarmclaw` uses a hybrid router. Some legacy rich commands still support `-u/--url`, `-k/--key`, and `--raw`; mapped API commands use the options above.

### Command Groups

Run `swarmclaw --help` to list all groups and commands (the list evolves as APIs are added).
Notable setup/operations groups include:

| Group | Purpose |
|-|-|
| `setup` | Setup helpers like provider checks and `doctor` diagnostics |
| `version` | Version status and update helpers |
| `sessions` | Session lifecycle, chat, browser/devserver controls, mailbox |
| `chatrooms` | Multi-agent chatrooms (members, reactions, streamed room chat) |
| `memory` | Memory CRUD and maintenance utilities |
| `notifications` | In-app notification listing and read-state controls |
